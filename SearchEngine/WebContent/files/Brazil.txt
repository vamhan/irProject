The Brazil national football team (Portuguese: Seleção Brasileira) represents Brazil in international men's football. Brazil is administered by the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), the governing body for football in Brazil. They have been a member of the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) since 1923 and member of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) since 1916.

Brazil is the most successful national football team in the history of the FIFA World Cup, with five championships: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. They are also the most successful team in the FIFA Confederations Cup with four titles. Brazil are the current holders of the FIFA Confederations Cup after winning the 1997, 2005, 2009, and 2013 edition of the tournament. Brazil is the only national team to have played in every World Cup.[9]

Brazil national football team has the all-time highest average Football Elo Ranking in the world with 2010.8, and the second all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in the world, with 2153 in 1962, just behind the Hungarian Golden Team of 1954. Its achievements have led CONMEBOL to consider it as the most glorious and successful of all national teams from South America and the World.[10][11][12][13][14] The national team are currently ranked number 1 in the World Football Elo Ratings[4] and 9 in the FIFA World Ranking.

Brazil is the only team to have won the world cup in four different continents: once in Europe (1958 Sweden), once in South America (1962 Chile), twice in North America (1970 Mexico and 1994 United States) and once in Asia (2002 Korea/Japan). They also share with Spain a record of 35 consecutive official matches undefeated.[15][16][17] A common quip about football is: "Os ingleses o inventaram, os brasileiros o aperfeiçoaram" ("The English invented it, the Brazilians perfected it").[18][19]

Brazil are the hosts of the 2014 World Cup and therefore automatically qualified for the tournament.
